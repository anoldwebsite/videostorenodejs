/*
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req),
the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response
cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked,
executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware in the stack.
If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle,
it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function.
Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.
